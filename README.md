# 2048_Game_Bot

These are files for a program I wrote in the thick of the pandemic, in 2020.

I got bored, so I wrote a program to play the game 2048. 
If you've never seen this game before, check out [play2048.co](https::/play2048.co)

The program I wrote in 2020 opens up a chrome browser using the library
*selenium*, then it navigates to the website, and starts playing the game automatically. 

Here's a really well-shot video of the bot in action:

INSERT VIDEO HERE! 

However, PLEASE NOTE that the python code is... really awful.
Zero good software engineering practices.
* Comments? Nope
* DRY code? Nope
* test cases? Nope

The long-term goal here is to re-write the program logic in C++ to make it run faster, while still using python for interacting with the website.
